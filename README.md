Greplin Challenge in Python: README
==============

== Intro ==
This is simply the code, unaltered, that I used to solve the Greplin programming challenge in Python. The code is not necessarily good looking or optimized. It's basically what I would do if I wanted to get something done; a balance between clever and fast (and hopefully correct).

Should be useful for anyone who's curious about my thought process. Obviously production code is going to be cleaner. Also might be helpful to people who just want to see a solution in Python vs. their native language.

That's all!
